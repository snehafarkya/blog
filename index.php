It is actually from earlier years of my life that I like to express something in written format. Be it story writing, content creation, or narration of dramas/plays. I did all of these back in my school days. Well, I've never stopped writing since then!  </p><br>";
echo "<p>Throughout the initial year of my college, I got guidance from some very talented and inspiring friends/Seniors. I am grateful to <b>Jaspreet, Yash, and Sumit</b>, as well as the entire HEKORS community for their help. By writing the ReadMe file for Eccentric Touch, Yash provided me with an opportunity to contribute to the project. </p><br>";

Mr. Singh offered me a role as a content writer for TBC, and I jumped at the chance.  I was agog to do this job. I started writing some good stuff, according to client's demand. And by far, I'm enjoying it!</p><br>";
